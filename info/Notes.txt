# Portfolio Website Build Notes
Personal notes on building my developer portfolio

---

## 📌 Inspiration
Used Brittany Chiang's portfolio as a reference - love her sleek, modern design that balances personality with professionalism.

## 🎯 Goals
Build a personal portfolio website that showcases:
- Who I am (About section)
- My work experience (Experience section)
- Projects I've built (Projects section)
- Technical skills (Skills section)
- Certifications (Certifications section)

## 📐 Site Structure I Followed
1. Landing Section – Name, title, short tagline
2. About Me – Bio and what I do
3. Experience – Work history and internships
4. Projects – Showcase best work with links
5. Skills – Technical proficiencies
6. Certifications – Professional credentials
7. Contact – Social links and email

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- React 18 (component-based architecture)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Vite (fast build tool)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- shadcn/ui (pre-built UI components)
- Lucide React (icons)
- React Router (navigation)

## ✅ Design Decisions
- Dark theme with navy/slate color palette
- Split-layout: sticky left sidebar + scrollable right content
- Teal accent color for highlights and links
- Smooth scroll behavior between sections
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
